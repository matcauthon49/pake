	abstract = { A new public-key encryption scheme, along with several variants, is proposed and analyzed. The scheme and its variants are quite practical and are proved secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack under standard intractability assumptions. These appear to be the first public-key encryption schemes in the literature that are simultaneously practical and provably secure. }
