\section{UC-Security of KOY in the Algebraic Group Model}

We will show the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}
	\label{thm:agm}
	The protocol of \cref{fig:koy} UC-realizes the $\pake$ functionality in the Algebraic Group Model under the SDH and DDH Assumptions.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Notation}

Before we proceed, we describe some notation and terminology. Our proof will proceed via a sequence of hybrids. We will show that the advantage of the adversary in game $\game_0$ (which corresponds to the real-world attack) is at most negligibly greater than that of the adversary in game $\game_9$, which corresponds to the ideal world.

Let $Z_i$ denote the event that $\mathcal{Z}$ outputs $1$ in game $G_i$. We need to show that $Z_0\cong Z_9$, which corresponds to the fact that the real world attack is indistinguishable from the ideal world attack.

We refer to the system of $\party_0$ and $\party_1$ as the \textit{challenger}. The challenger plays the role of $\user$ and $\server$ and carries out all interactions with the adversary (and hence, the environment). We denote each password as a group element $\pw = g^{\pw'}$ where $\pw$ is an element of the password dictionary $\{1,\dots,N\}$. We assume that the size of the password dictionary is small, ie. $N<q$.

Let $\msg{i}$ denote the $i$th message output by the challenger. This message is relayed to the adversary, and the (algebraic) adversary responds with a message $\msg{i}^{*}$ along with a message $\msg{i}^{'*}$ which is an algebraic representation of the elements it has seen so far. 


\subsection{Overview}

The broad strokes of our proof are as below.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item In game $\game_0'$, the experiment is aborted if any of the following events happen.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A $\VK$ is reused. In this case, the challenger detects this in the message that is output, sends an $\abort$ and ends the protocol.
		\item The server generates $\msg{2}$ twice for different $\sid$s. The challenger detects this in the message that is output, sends an $\abort$ and ends the protocol.
		\item The challenger detects at some point that the adversary has been able to produce a new signed message for some honestly-generated $\VK$ without knowing the corresponding signing key (which it can't, because the $\VK$ is honestly generated -- if it was the one who generated that $\VK$, the adversary is allowed to do whatever it wants with it).
		\item At any given point, the challenger detects that a collision has occured in the hash function. In this case the challenger again sends an $\abort$ and terminates the protocol.
	\end{enumerate}
	This is indistinguishable from the attack $\game_0$ because the probability of any of these events happening is unlikely due to the security of the hash functions and the one-time signature scheme.
	
	\item In game $\game_1$, the challenger changes the way that the $\crs$ is generated. In this case, the $\crs$ is now generated according to the techniques laid out in the Cramer-Shoup $\keygen$ procedure. The distribution of generated values is information-theoretically identical; the only difference is that now the challenger has planted trapdoors into the description of the $\crs$, and it knows the discrete logs of $h, c$ and $d$. The simulator is going to (eventually) use this to extract a password guess.
	
	\item In game $\game_2$, the challenger considers the messages $\msg{i}^{*}$ received from the adversary, and uses the parameters in $\game_1$ to extract a password guess. If the password guess is correct, it extracts the computed session key in the compromised protocol and sets it to be $\sk_i$. Note that the change is purely conceptual; the game is indistinguishable from the previous one. The extraction of $\sk_i$ requires us to use the algebraic exponents delivered by the adversary; this part of the proof requires the AGM.
	
	\item In game $\game_3$, the challenger deals with incoming $\msg{3}^{*}$ queries. It checks the $\sid$ of the message and in case that $\msg{1} = \msg{1}^{*}$, it sets $\sk_\server:=\sk_\user$ for the same $\sid$, which was already previously computed (at the time that $\msg{3}$ was output).  Note that in this case $\msg{3}$ \textit{has} to be output by the client -- the only situation in which this doesn't happen is if the environment was able to forge some $(K,\mathsf{sig})$, but $\game_0'$ necessitates abort in the case that this occurs. Thus, the game is valid, and furthermore is indistinguishable because this is, again, only a conceptual change.
	
	\item In game $\game_4$, the challenger again deals with incoming $\msg{3}^{*}$ queries. It again checks the $\sid$ of the message and in the case that $\msg{1}\neq\msg{1}^{*}$ and furthermore the message is an invalid Cramer-Shoup ciphertext of $\pw_\user$, the challenger outputs a session key $\sk_\server$ \textit{at random}. The proof of indistinguishability proceeds from an information-theoretic argument.
	
	\item In game $\game_5$, the challenger replaces the server's Cramer-Shoup encryption of $\pw_\user$ with an encryption of some $g^k\notin\mathcal{PW}$. The proof of indistinguishability follows from the fact that any environment which can differentiate between the two games can also be used as a subroutine to break the CCA-security of Cramer-Shoup.
	
	\item In game $\game_6$, the challenger considers $\msg{2}^{*}$. If $\msg{2}^{*}=\msg{2}$, then the challenger sets $\sk_\user$ to be random. The proof of this game is similar to that of $\game_3$.
	
	\item In game $\game_7$, the challenger considers $\msg{2}^{*}$ again, and the case in which $\msg{2}^{*}\neq\msg{2}$ but the message does not contain a valid password guess, it sets $\sk_\user$ to be random as well. The proof is again similar.
	
	\item In game $\game_8$, the challenger replaces the client's Cramer-Shoup encryption of $\pw_\user$ with an encryption of some $g^k\notin\mathcal{PW}$. The proof of indistinguishability follows from the DR-CCA security of Cramer-Shoup, which is discussed in \cref{appendix-a}.
	
	\item Game $\game_9$ is the ideal functionality. We argue that the structure of $\game_8$ can be interpreted as the ideal functionality with no security loss.	
\end{enumerate} 


\subsection{Proof of UC-Security}

We now provide a formal description of the proof.

\textbf{Game $\game_0$.} This game corresponds to the real-world attack.

\textbf{Game $\game_0'$.} In this game, the challenger interacts with the adversary as before, except we introduce an additional abort clause. If this clause is activated, then the challenger sends a message $\abort$ and ends the protocol. The abort clause is activated in the case of the following situations:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The verification key $\VK$ is used more than once by the system. This encompasses the case when the client's generation algorithm outputs $\VK$ twice for two separate instantiations in two separate sessions.
	\item The server generates a $\msg{2}$ which is identical to a different $\msg{2}$ generated in a separate session.
	\item Consider $(\SK,\VK)$ to be honest outputs of $\OTS.\keygen(1^\secpar)$ by the client. Then if the adversary is able to output some $\mathsf{sig}'$ which was \textit{not} generated by the challenger using the signing algorithm, and $\mathsf{Vrfy}_\VK(\mathsf{sig}')=1$. 
	\item A collision occurs in the hash function.
\end{enumerate}

We will show that the probability of each of these cases is negligible. 

For $(2)$, this is information-theoretic: the only way this can happen is if the selected exponents repeated, which occurs with negligible probability in $\secpar$. 

$(4)$ occurs with negligible probability by the collision-resistance of the hash function $\mathsf{HF}$.

Case $(1)$ and $(3)$ occur with negligible probability by fact that $\OTS$ is a one-time signature scheme.


It follows that $$\Pr[Z_0] \leq \Pr[Z_0']+\negl(\secpar).$$

\textbf{Game $\game_1$.} In this game, the challenger changes the way that $\crs$ is sampled. In particular, it uses the following initialization algorithm described in \cref{fig:initialization-game-1}. Note that the initialization algorithm closely resembles that of the setup of the Cramer-Shoup encryption scheme.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\FrameSep5pt
	\begin{framed}\small
		\textbf{Initialization}: Let $\Gamma[\hat{\G},\G,g,q]\rgets[S_\secpar]$. Set $g_1\gets g$, $g_2\rgets\overline{\G}$. Choose $$\kappa\rgets\Z_q^{*}; (\chi_1,\chi_2),(\zeta_1,\zeta_2)\rgets\{(x,y)\in\Z_p^2:g_1^xg_2^y\neq 1\}$$ and set $h:=g_1^\kappa$, $c:=g_1^{\chi_1}g_2^{\chi_2}$ and $d:=g_1^{\zeta_1}g_2^{\zeta_2}$. Furthermore, $\hk\rgets\mathsf{HF.Keyspace}_{\lambda,\Gamma}$. Output $\crs = (\Gamma,g_1, g_2,h,c,d,\hk)$.
	\end{framed}
	\caption{Challenger's modified initialization algorithm in $\game_1$.}
	\label{fig:initialization-game-1}
\end{figure}

Note that the distribution of $\crs$ in $\game_1$ and $\game_0'$ is identical. The only elements which are chosen differently are $h, c$ and $d$, however their distribution is still uniform in $\overline{\G}$. Thus, it follows that $$\Pr[Z_0'] = \Pr[Z_1].$$

Before we continue, we introduce some additional, helpful terminology. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item If $\msg{i}^{*}\neq\msg{i}$, we say that it is \textit{adversarially-generated}.
	\item Consider $\msg{1}^{*}$. If either $A^{\chi_1+\alpha\zeta_1}B^{\chi_2+\alpha\zeta_2}\neq D$ or $C/\pw_\user\neq A^\kappa$, then $\msg{1}$ is \textit{invalid}, otherwise it is \textit{valid}.
	\item Consider $\msg{2}^{*}$. If either $F^{\chi_1+\alpha\zeta_1}G^{\chi_2+\alpha\zeta_2}\neq J$ or $I/\pw_\user\neq F^\kappa$, then $\msg{1}$ is \textit{invalid}, otherwise it is \textit{valid}.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Game $\game_2$.} In this game, the challenger makes two changes. After this game, the password will no longer be used in computing the session key, except implicitly.

When the challenger receives $\msg{2}^{*}$, it examines it. In the case that $\msg{2}^{*}$ is adversarially-generated and valid, it considers the adversary's algebraic exponents $(x_2,y_2,z_2,w_2,r_2)$, which were provided along with $\msg{2}^{*}$. It then computes $$\pw'=\frac{I/I'}{C/C'}$$ and sets the session key $\sk_\user = E^{r_1}F^{x_1}G^{y_1}(I')^{z_1}J^{w_1}(\pw')^{z_2}$. The challenger then responds to the message with $\msg{3}^{*}$ exactly as it does in $\game_1$. 

When the challenger receives $\msg{3}^{*}$, it examines $\msg{1}^{*}$ for the corresponding $\sid$. If $\msg{1}^{*}$ is adversarially generated and valid, it considers and the adversary's algebraic exponents output with $\msg{3}^{*}$ and $\msg{1}^{'*}$ as $(x_1,y_1,z_1,w_1,r_1)$. If $\mathsf{Vrfy}_\VK(\msg{1}\|\msg{2}\|K,\mathsf{sig})=1$, it computes $$C':= \frac{C}{I/h^{r_1}}$$ and sets the session key $\sk_\server = A^{x_2}B^{y_2}(C')^{z_2}D^{w_2}K^{r_2}$.

\begin{lemma} We have
	$$\Pr[Z_1]=\Pr[Z_2].$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	It is clear that the distribution on the adversary's (and environment's) view until an adversarially-generated and valid message is detected is identical. In the case such a message \textit{is} detected, note that by correctness of the protocol of \cref{fig:koy} we have
	\begin{align*}
		\pw'=\frac{I/I'}{C/C'}=1\\
		\frac{C}{I/h^{r_1}} = \frac{C}{\pw_\user}
	\end{align*}
	and hence $$E^{r_1}F^{x_1}G^{y_1}(I')^{z_1}J^{w_1} = E^{r_1}F^{x_1}G^{y_1}(I')^{z_1}J^{w_1}(\pw')^{z_2}.$$ Thus there is no difference in the distribution of $\sk_i$ between $\game_1$ and $\game_2$, and the proposition follows.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Game $\game_3$.} In this game the challenger modifies how it deals with an incoming $\msg{3}^{*}$. Upon receiving this message, it checks the corresponding $\msg{1}^{*}$ of $\sid.$ If $\msg{1}^{*}$ is not adversarially-generated, then it finds the unique $\sk_\user$ for $\sid$ and sets $\sk_\server := \sk_\user$. In any other case it proceeds as in $\game_2$.

At first it is not clear why such a corresponding $\sk_\user$ exists. However, this follows from the fact that the protocol did not $\abort$. Hence, there is some unique $\sid$ for which the $\VK$ corresponding to $\msg{3}^{*}$ was used, and furthermore this is the same $\sid$ corresponding to $\msg{3}^{*}$, because a case of successful verification if the two $\sid$s were not equal would mean a signature was forged. Both these situations are prohibited by the $\abort$ clause introduced in game $\game_0'$.

Note that in $\game_2$ it is true that in the case of honestly generated $\msg{1}$, $\sk_\user = \sk_\server$. Hence, the following is unconditionally true: $$\Pr[Z_2]=\Pr[Z_3].$$

\textbf{Game $\game_4$.} In this game the challenger deals with an incoming $\msg{3}^{*}$ with a corresponding $\msg{1}^{*}$ that is adversarially-generated but invalid. If this is indeed the case, it outputs $\sk_\server\rgets\G$. In any other case it proceeds as in $\game_3$.

\begin{lemma}
	We have $$\Pr[Z_3]=\Pr[Z_4].$$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We will proceed via an information-theoretic argument. Note that $\msg{1}^{*}$ is adversarially-generated and invalid. Hence, there are two possibilities: either $A^{\chi_1+\alpha\zeta_1}B^{\chi_2+\alpha\zeta_2}\neq D$, or $C/\pw_\user\neq A^\kappa$. Consider now the random variables $E$ and $\sk_\server$, which are determined completely by the choices of $(x,y,z,w)$ and $(A,B,C,D,K)$. We can rewrite these as the following linear system, in which the logarithms are taken over base $g$:
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:linear}
		\begin{pmatrix}
			\log E\\
			\log\sk_\server-r\log K
		\end{pmatrix} =
		\begin{pmatrix}
			1 & \log g_2 & \log h & \log cd^\alpha\\
			\log A& \log B & \log \left(\frac{C}{\pw_\user}\right) & \log D
		\end{pmatrix}
		\begin{pmatrix}
			x\\
			y\\
			z\\
			w
		\end{pmatrix}
	\end{equation}

	It is easy to see that these equations are linearly independent. If $A^{\chi_1+\alpha\zeta_1}B^{\chi_2+\alpha\zeta_2}\neq D$, then note that $(\chi_1+\alpha\zeta_1) + (\chi_2+\alpha\zeta_2)\log g_2 = \log cd^{\alpha}$, while if $C/\pw_\user\neq A^\kappa$, then the independence is trivial. Then for any fixed values of $\mu, \nu$, the probability that $\log E=\mu$ and $\log\sk_\server-r\log K=\nu$ is exactly $1/q^2$. Hence, the value of $\sk_\server$ is completely independent of the value of $E$, and it follows that the distribution of $\sk_\server$ appears uniform to the adversary in $\game_3$, which is the same as $\game_4$.
\end{proof}


\textbf{Game $\game_5$.} In this game the challenger modifies how it determines $\msg{2}$. On receiving $\msg{1}^{*}$, instead of setting $I:=h^r\cdot g^{\pw_\user'}$, it sets $I:=h^rg^{N+1}$ which is not a valid $\pw$ as determined by the password dictionary. 

\begin{lemma}
	Under the SDSH assumption, we have $$|\Pr[Z_4]-\Pr[Z_5]|\leq\negl(\lambda).$$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We show that any environment $\env$ which can differentiate between $\game_4$ and $\game_5$ can be used as a subroutine to build an adversary $\adv$ which can break the DR-CCA-security game (\cref{fig:dcca}) for Cramer-Shoup with labels (\cref{fig:cs03}) by successfully distinguishing between target ciphertexts. 
	
	We provide a description of $\adv$ as follows. $\adv$ begins by querying the key generation oracle and receiving the public key $\PK = (\Gamma,\hk,g_1,g_2,c,d,h)$. It sets the $\crs = (\Gamma,g_1,g_2,h,c,d,\hk)$ and begins a simulation for the challenger and a dummy adversary. This simulation proceeds as in $\game_4$, with the following difference:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item On receiving a message $\msg{1}^{*}$, $\adv$ chooses $m_0:=(\pw_\user)$ (which was provided by $Z$) and $m_1:=g^{N+1}$ as messages for the encryption oracle. It receives in return a ciphertext $\psi^{*}$, and sets $(F,G,I,J):=\psi^{*}$.
		\item On receiving an adversarially generated message $\msg{2}^{*}$, the challenger needs to determine whether this message is valid or invalid (recall that in this setting the initialization procedure has not been backdoored). To do this, it queries the decryption oracle with $(F,G,I,J)$, and sets the message to be valid if it is an encryption of $\pw_\user$ and invalid otherwise.
		\item On receiving an adversarially generated message $\msg{3}^{*}$, the challenger again needs to determine whether $\msg{1}^{*}$ is valid or invalid. To do so, it again queries the decryption oracle with $(A,B,C,D)$ and sets the message to be valid if it is an encryption of $\pw_\user$ and invalid otherwise.
		\item The simulator determines the algebraic exponents of the $K$ delivered by the adversary using $\msg{3}^{'*}$ and queries the auxiliary oracle to receive $\aux = (g_1^{r_2^2}, g_2^{r_2^2}, c^{r_2}, d^{r_2},(h^{r_2}\cdot m_i)^{r_2},(cd^{\alpha})^{{r_2}^2})$. Using this, in the case that $\msg{1}^{*}$ is adversarially generated and valid, it determines $\sk_\server = A^{x_2}B^{y_2}C^{z_2}D^{w_2}K^{r_2}$, since $K$ is completely determined as some function of $\aux$. It then releases $\sk_\server$ to $\mathcal{Z}$.
	\end{itemize}

	$\adv$ then outputs what $\mathcal{Z}$ outputs.

	It is clear that the above simulation corresponds to a correct simulation of $\game_4$ if the returned ciphertext $\psi^{*}$ is an encryption of $m_0$ while it corresponds to a simulation of $\game_5$ if the returned ciphertext is a simulation of $m_1$. It follows that $$|\Pr[Z_4]-\Pr[Z_5]|\leq\drcca_{\adv}(\lambda)\leq \negl(\lambda).$$ 
\end{proof}

\textbf{Game $\game_6$.} In this game the challenger deals with incoming message $\msg{2}^{*}$. If $\msg{2}^{*}$ is honest, then it assigns the client's session key $\sk_\user$ uniformly chosen in $\G$.

The proof of indistinguishability of this game is closely related to that of game $\game_4$. It is true here that either $F^{\chi_1+\beta\zeta_1}G^{\chi_2+\beta\zeta_2}\neq J$ or $I/\pw_\user\neq F^\kappa$. A linear family similar to \cref{eq:linear} follows, and the proof of linear independence is also nearly identical. We can conclude that the session key is uniform in $\game_5$, and equivalence follows immediately: $$\Pr[Z_5]=\Pr[Z_6].$$

\textbf{Game $\game_7$.} In this game the challenger deals with incoming message $\msg{2}^{*}$. If $\msg{2}^{*}$ is adversarially-generated but invalid, then it assigns the client's session key $\sk_\user$ uniformly chosen in $\G$.

Note that it is true here as well that either $F^{\chi_1+\beta\zeta_1}G^{\chi_2+\beta\zeta_2}\neq J$ or $I/\pw_\user\neq F^\kappa$. The argument is identical to $\game_6$, and we get $$\Pr[Z_6]=\Pr[Z_7].$$

\textbf{Game $\game_8$.} In this game the challenger modifies the client's response to the opening $\newsession$ message. It computes $C:=h^{r}g_1^{N+1}$, similar to how it does in game $\game_5$, setting it to be an invalid password. 

\begin{lemma}
	Under the DSDH and the DDH assumptions, $$|\Pr[Z_7]-\Pr[Z_8]|\leq\negl(\secpar).$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Like the proof of $\game_5$, we will show that any environment $\mathcal{Z}$ which can differentiate between the two games can be used to build an adversary which breaks the DR-CCA game for Cramer--Shoup with labels.
	
	The description of the adversary $\mathcal{A}$ is as follows. $\adv$ begins by querying the key generation oracle and receiving the public key $\PK = (\Gamma,\hk,g_1,g_2,c,d,h)$. It sets the $\crs = (\Gamma,g_1,g_2,h,c,d,\hk)$ and begins a simulation for the challenger and a dummy adversary. This simulation proceeds as in $\game_7$, with the following difference:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item On receiving a message $\newsession$, $\adv$ chooses $m_0:=(\pw_\user)$ (which was provided by $Z$) and $m_1:=g^{N+1}$ as messages for the encryption oracle. It receives in return a ciphertext $\psi^{*}$, and sets $(A,B,C,D):=\psi^{*}$.
		\item On receiving an adversarially generated message $\msg{2}^{*}$, the challenger needs to determine whether this message is valid or invalid (recall that in this setting the initialization procedure has not been backdoored). To do this, it queries the decryption oracle with $(F,G,I,J)$, and sets the message to be valid if it is an encryption of $\pw_\user$ and invalid otherwise.
		\item On receiving an adversarially generated message $\msg{3}^{*}$, the challenger again needs to determine whether $\msg{1}^{*}$ is valid or invalid. To do so, it again queries the decryption oracle with $(A,B,C,D)$ and sets the message to be valid if it is an encryption of $\pw_\user$ and invalid otherwise.
		\item The simulator determines the algebraic exponents of the $E$ delivered by the adversary using $\msg{2}^{'*}$ and queries the auxiliary oracle to receive $\aux = (g_1^{r_1^2}, g_2^{r_1^2}, c^{r_1}, d^{r_1},(h^{r_1}\cdot m_i)^{r_1},(cd^{\alpha})^{{r_1}^2})$. Using this, in the case that $\msg{2}^{*}$ is adversarially generated and valid, it determines $\sk_\user = E^{r_1}F^{x_1}G^{y_1}(I')^{z_1}J^{w_1}(\pw')^{z_2}$, since $E$ is completely determined as a function of $\aux$. It then releases $\sk_\user$ to $\mathcal{Z}$.
	\end{itemize}

	$\adv$ then outputs what $\mathcal{Z}$ outputs.
	
	It is clear that the above is a correct simulation of $\game_7$ when $m_0$ is encrypted and $\game_8$ when $m_1$ is encrypted. It follows immediately that $$|\Pr[Z_7]-\Pr[Z_8]|\leq\drcca_{\adv}(\secpar)\leq\negl(\secpar).$$
\end{proof}

\textbf{Game $\game_9$.} In this game we introduce the simulator shown in \cref{fig:agm-sim}. It is easy to see that the simulator does exactly what is done by the challenger of $\game_8$, except for determining whether a message is invalid or valid, which is done by $\pake$. Once this has been determined, it continues the simulation and finds the session key $\sk_i$, which is delegated to $\pake$.

We have found that $\Pr[Z_8]=\Pr[Z_9]$. From the preceding games we can conclude that under the SDSH and DDH assumptions, $$|\Pr[Z_0]-\Pr[Z_9]|\leq\negl(\secpar).$$
