\section{UC-Security of KOY in the Algebraic Group Model}

In this section, we show the UC-security of the KOY protocol in the Algebraic Group Model (AGM). We adopt the UC-AGM security notion in \cite{AC:ABKLX21}, which (roughly speaking) requires both the UC adversary and the environment to be algebraic.

\begin{theorem}
	\label{thm:agm}
	The protocol of \cref{fig:koy} UC-realizes the $\pake$ functionality in the Algebraic Group Model under the DSDH assumption for $\mathcal{G}$.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Notation}

Before we proceed, we describe some notation and terminology. Our proof will proceed via a sequence of hybrids. We will show that the distinguishing advantage of any PPT environment $\mathcal{Z}$ in game $\game_0$ (which corresponds to the real-world attack) and in game $\game_9$ (which corresponds to the ideal world) is negligible. That is, let $Z_i$ denote the event that $\mathcal{Z}$ outputs 1 in game $\game_i$; we need to show that $Z_0\cong Z_9$.

We refer to the combination of $\user$ and $\server$ as the \textit{challenger}, which carries out all interactions with the adversary and the environment. In particular, let $\msg{i}$ denote the $i$-th message output by the challenger; this message is relayed to the adversary, and the (algebraic) adversary responds with a message $\msg{i}^{*}$ (which may or may not be equal to $\msg{i}$) along with an algebraic representation ``explaining'' how the group elements in $\msg{i}^*$ were computed based on the group elements it has seen so far. $\user$'s first message. $\msg{1}$, is triggered by the environment's $\newsession$ message, and when $\user$ or $\server$ completes a session, the key is output to the environment.

\subsection{Proof Overview}

The broad strokes of our proof are as below.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{-1}
	\item In game $\game_0'$, the experiment is aborted if any of the following events happen.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A $\VK$ (which is part of $\msg{1}$) is reused for different $\sid$'s.
		\item $\server$ generates the same $\msg{2}$ twice for different $\sid$'s.
		\item The challenger detects at some point that the adversary has been able to produce a new signature for $\VK$ in some honestly generated $\msg{1}$ (so the adversary does not know the corresponding signing key).
		\item At any given point, the challenger detects that a collision has occured in the hash function. In this case the challenger again sends an $\abort$ and terminates the protocol.
	\end{enumerate}
	This is indistinguishable from the attack $\game_0$ because the probability of any of these events happening is unlikely due to the security of the hash function and the one-time signature scheme.
	
	\item In game $\game_1$, the challenger changes the way that the CRS is generated. In this case, $\crs$ is now generated according to the Cramer--Shoup $\keygen$ procedure, and the challenger records the secret key, i.e., the discrete logs of $h, c, d$. The simulator is going to (eventually) use this to extract the adversary's password guesses.
	
	\item In game $\game_2$, the challenger considers the messages $\msg{i}^{*}$ received from the adversary, and uses the secret key recorded in $\game_1$ to extract a password guess. If the password guess is correct, it then computes the session key in the compromised instance and sets it to be $\sk_i$. Computing $\sk_i$ requires us to use the algebraic exponents delivered by the adversary, i.e., this part of the proof requires the AGM.
	
	\item In game $\game_3$, the challenger deals with incoming $\msg{3}^{*}$ messages. It checks the $\sid$ of the message and in case that $\msg{1}^{*} = \msg{1}$ (i.e., the adversary did not modify the first message), it sets $\sk_\server:=\sk_\user$ for the same $\sid$, which was already previously computed (at the time that $\msg{3}$ was sent). The only situation in which $\game_3$ is different from $\game_2$ is if the adversary was able to forge some $(K,\mathsf{sig})$, but this has already been ruled out in $\game_0'$.
	
	\item In game $\game_4$, the challenger again deals with incoming $\msg{3}^{*}$ messages. It again checks the $\sid$ of the message and in the case that $\msg{1}^{*}\neq\msg{1}$ and furthermore the message is a Cramer--Shoup ciphertext of $\pw_\server$, the challenger outputs a session key $\sk_\server$ \textit{at random}. The proof of indistinguishability proceeds from an information-theoretic argument.
	
	\item In game $\game_5$, the challenger replaces the server's Cramer--Shoup encryption of $\pw_\server$ (in $\msg{2}$) with an encryption of some ``dummy'' $g^k\notin\mathsf{Dict}$. The proof of indistinguishability follows from the DR-CCA-security of the Cramer--Shoup encryption scheme, which is discussed in \cref{appendix-a}.
	
	\item In game $\game_6$, the challenger considers $\msg{2}^{*}$. If $\msg{2}^{*}=\msg{2}$, then the challenger sets $\sk_\user$ to be random. The proof of indistinguishability is similar to that of $\game_3$.
	
	\item In game $\game_7$, the challenger considers $\msg{2}^{*}$ again, and if $\msg{2}^{*}\neq\msg{2}$ but the message is not an encryption of $\pw_\user$, it sets $\sk_\user$ to be random as well. The proof is again similar.
	
	\item In game $\game_8$, the challenger replaces the client's Cramer--Shoup encryption of $\pw_\user$ with an encryption of some ``dummy'' $g^k\notin\mathsf{Dict}$. The proof of indistinguishability follows from the DR-CCA security of Cramer--Shoup.
	
	\item Game $\game_9$ is the ideal world. We argue that the challenger in $\game_8$ can be interpreted as the combination of the UC PAKE functionality and a simulator.
\end{enumerate} 


\subsection{Proof of \cref{thm:agm}}

We now provide a formal description of the proof of \cref{thm:agm}. Let $\env$ be any PPT environment, and $\adv$ be the ``dummy'' adversary that merely passes messages between $\env$ and protocol parties.

\medskip
\textbf{Game $\game_0$.} This game corresponds to the real-world attack.

\medskip
\textbf{Game $\game_0'$.} In this game, we introduce an additional abort clause. If this clause is activated, then the challenger sends a message $\abort$ and halts. The abort clause is activated in the case of the following situations:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The verification key $\VK$ (in $\msg{1}$) is used more than once by the system. This encompasses the case when $\user$'s key generation algorithm outputs $\VK$ twice for two separate instantiations in two separate sessions.
	\item $\server$ generates a $\msg{2}$ which is identical to a different $\msg{2}$ generated in a separate session.
	\item Consider $(\SK,\VK)$ to be honest outputs of $\OTS.\keygen(1^\secpar)$ by the client. The situation is that $\adv$ is able to output some $\mathsf{sig}'$ which was \textit{not} generated by the challenger as part of $\msg{3}$, and $\mathsf{Vrfy}_\VK(\msg{1},\msg{2},K;\mathsf{sig}')=1$. 
	\item A collision occurs in the hash function.
\end{enumerate}

We will show that the probability of each of these cases is negligible in $\secpar$. 

For $(2)$, this is information-theoretic: the only way this can happen is if the selected exponents repeated, which occurs with negligible probability. 

$(4)$ occurs with negligible probability by the collision-resistance of the hash function $\mathsf{HF}$.

Case $(1)$ and $(3)$ occur with negligible probability by assumption that $\OTS$ is a one-time signature scheme.


It follows that $$\Pr[Z_0] \leq \Pr[Z_0']+\negl(\secpar).$$

\textbf{Game $\game_1$.} In this game, the challenger changes the way that $\crs$ is sampled. In particular, it uses the initialization algorithm described in \cref{fig:initialization-game-1}. Note that the initialization algorithm closely resembles that of the setup of the Cramer--Shoup encryption scheme.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\FrameSep5pt
	\begin{framed}\small
		\textbf{Initialization}: Let $\Gamma[\G,g,q]\rgets[S_\secpar]$. Set $g_1:= g$ and sample $g_2\rgets\overline{\G}$. Sample $$\kappa\rgets\Z_q^{*}; (\chi_1,\chi_2),(\zeta_1,\zeta_2)\rgets\{(x,y)\in\Z_p^2:g_1^xg_2^y\neq 1\}$$ and set $h:=g_1^\kappa$, $c:=g_1^{\chi_1}g_2^{\chi_2}$ and $d:=g_1^{\zeta_1}g_2^{\zeta_2}$. Furthermore, sample $\hk\rgets\mathsf{HF.Keyspace}_{\lambda,\Gamma}$. Output $\crs := (\Gamma,g_1, g_2,h,c,d,\hk)$.
	\end{framed}
	\caption{Challenger's modified initialization algorithm in $\game_1$.}
	\label{fig:initialization-game-1}
\end{figure}

Note that the distribution of $\crs$ in $\game_1$ and $\game_0'$ is identical: the only elements which are chosen differently are $h, c$ and $d$, however their distribution is still uniform in $\overline{\G}$. It follows that $$\Pr[Z_0'] = \Pr[Z_1].$$

Before we continue, we introduce some additional, helpful terminology. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item If $\msg{i}^{*}\neq\msg{i}$, we say that it is \textit{adversarially generated}. (Intuitively this means that the man-in-the-middle adversary $\adv$ modifies $\msg{i}$.) Otherwise we say $\msg{i}^*$ is \emph{honestly generated}.
	\item Consider $\msg{1}^{*} = (\sid,\VK,A,B,C,D)$. If either $A^{\chi_1+\alpha\zeta_1}B^{\chi_2+\alpha\zeta_2}\neq D$ or $C/\pw_\server\neq A^\kappa$, then $\msg{1}^*$ is \textit{invalid}, otherwise it is \textit{valid}. (Intuitively a valid $\msg{1}^*$ contains the correct password guess for $\server$, and an invalid $\msg{1}^*$ contains an incorrect password guess or no password guess at all.)
	\item Consider $\msg{2}^{*} = (\sid,E,F,G,I,J)$. If either $F^{\chi_1+\alpha\zeta_1}G^{\chi_2+\alpha\zeta_2}\neq J$ or $I/\pw_\user\neq F^\kappa$, then $\msg{2}^*$ is \textit{invalid}, otherwise it is \textit{valid}. (Intuitively a valid $\msg{2}^*$ contains the correct password guess for $\user$, and an invalid $\msg{2}^*$ contains an incorrect password guess or no password guess at all.)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Game $\game_2$.} In this game, the challenger makes two changes regarding how the two parties' session keys are computed. After this game, the password will no longer be used in computing the session keys, except implicitly.

When the challenger receives $\msg{2}^{*}$, if it is adversarially generated and valid, the challenger considers $\adv$'s algebraic exponents $(x_2,y_2,z_2,w_2,r_2)$, which were provided along with $\msg{2}^{*}$. \xjy{This assumes that $\adv$ computes $E$ as $g_1^{x_2}g_2^{y_2}h^{z_2}c^{w_2}d^{\alpha w_2}$; what if $\adv$ computes $E = g_1^{x_2}g_2^{y_2}h^{z_2}c^{w_2}d^{v_2}A^{x_2'}B^{y_2'}C^{z_2'}D^{w_2'}\pw^{p_2}$?} It then computes $$\pw':=\frac{I/I'}{C/C'}$$ and sets the session key $\sk_\user := E^{r_1}F^{x_1}G^{y_1}(I')^{z_1}J^{w_1}(\pw')^{z_2}$. The challenger then responds to the message with $\msg{3}^{*}$ exactly as it does in $\game_1$.  \xjy{I am a bit lost here... what is $C'$ and what is $I'$? Note that in the real protocol $C' = C/\pw_\server$ and $I' = I/\pw_\user$, and the two passwords might be different}

When the challenger receives $\msg{3}^{*} = (K,\mathsf{sig})$, it examines $\msg{1}^{*}$ for the corresponding $\sid$. If $\msg{1}^{*}$ is adversarially generated and valid, it considers $\adv$'s algebraic exponents output with $\msg{1}^{*}$ and $\msg{3}^{*}$ as $(x_1,y_1,z_1,w_1,r_1)$. ($r_1$ is provided together with $\msg{1}^{*}$, and $(x_1,y_1,z_1,w_1)$ is provided together with $\msg{3}^*$.) If $\mathsf{Vrfy}_\VK(\msg{1}^*,\msg{2},K;\mathsf{sig})=1$, it computes $$C':= \frac{C}{I/h^{r_1}}$$ and sets the session key $\sk_\server := A^{x_2}B^{y_2}(C')^{z_2}D^{w_2}K^{r_2}$.

\begin{lemma}
	$\Pr[Z_1]=\Pr[Z_2]$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	It is clear that the distribution in $\adv$'s (and $\env$'s) view until an adversarially generated and valid message is detected is identical. In the case such a message \textit{is} detected, note that by correctness of the protocol of \cref{fig:koy} we have
	\begin{align*}
		\pw'=\frac{I/I'}{C/C'}=1\\
		\frac{C}{I/h^{r_1}} = \frac{C}{\pw_\user}
	\end{align*}
	and hence $$E^{r_1}F^{x_1}G^{y_1}(I')^{z_1}J^{w_1} = E^{r_1}F^{x_1}G^{y_1}(I')^{z_1}J^{w_1}(\pw')^{z_2}.$$ Thus there is no difference in the distribution of $\sk_i$ between $\game_1$ and $\game_2$, and the lemma follows.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Game $\game_3$.} In this game the challenger modifies how it deals with an incoming $\msg{3}^{*}$. Upon receiving this message, it checks the corresponding $\msg{1}^{*}$ of $\sid$. If $\msg{1}^{*}$ is honestly generated and $\pw_\user = \pw_\server$, then the challenger finds the unique $\sk_\user$ for $\sid$ and sets $\sk_\server := \sk_\user$. In any other case it proceeds as in $\game_2$.

At first glance it might not be clear why such a $\sk_\user$ exists. However, this follows from the fact that the protocol did not $\abort$. By the $\abort$ clause introduced in game $\game_0'$, there must be some unique $\sid$ for which the $\VK$ corresponding to $\msg{3}^{*}$ was used, and furthermore this is the same $\sid$ corresponding to $\msg{3}^{*}$ (because a case of successful verification if the two $\sid$'s were not equal would mean a signature was forged).

Note that in $\game_2$ it is true that in the case of honestly generated $\msg{1}$, $\sk_\user = \sk_\server$. Hence, the following is unconditionally true: $$\Pr[Z_2]=\Pr[Z_3].$$

\textbf{Game $\game_4$.} In this game the challenger deals with an incoming $\msg{3}^{*}$ with a corresponding $\msg{1}^{*}$ (of the same $\sid$) that is adversarially generated and invalid. If this is the case, it outputs $\sk_\server\rgets\G$. In any other case it proceeds as in $\game_3$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:invalid}
	$\Pr[Z_3]=\Pr[Z_4]$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We will proceed via an information-theoretic argument. Since $\msg{1}^{*}$ is adversarially generated and invalid, there are two possibilities: either $A^{\chi_1+\alpha\zeta_1}B^{\chi_2+\alpha\zeta_2}\neq D$, or $C/\pw_\server\neq A^\kappa$. Consider now the random variables $E$ and $\sk_\server$, which are determined completely by the choices of $(x_2,y_2,z_2,w_2)$ and $(A,B,C,D,K)$. We can rewrite these as the following linear system, in which the logarithms are taken over base $g = g_1$:
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:linear}
		\begin{pmatrix}
			\log E\\
			\log\sk_\server-r_2\log K
		\end{pmatrix} =
		\begin{pmatrix}
			1 & \log g_2 & \log h & \log (cd^\alpha)\\
			\log A& \log B & \log \left(\frac{C}{\pw_\server}\right) & \log D
		\end{pmatrix}
		\begin{pmatrix}
			x_2\\
			y_2\\
			z_2\\
			w_2
		\end{pmatrix}
	\end{equation}

	It is easy to see that these equations are linearly independent. \xjy{You mean the independence of the two equations in the above linear system?} If $A^{\chi_1+\alpha\zeta_1}B^{\chi_2+\alpha\zeta_2}\neq D$, then note that $(\chi_1+\alpha\zeta_1) + (\chi_2+\alpha\zeta_2)\log g_2 = \log (cd^\alpha)$, while if $C/\pw_\server\neq A^\kappa$, then the independence is trivial. Then for any fixed values of $\mu, \nu$, the probability that $\log E=\mu$ and $\log\sk_\server-r\log K=\nu$ is exactly $1/q^2$. Hence, the value of $\sk_\server$ is completely independent of the value of $E$, and it follows that the distribution of $\sk_\server$ is uniform and independent of $\adv$'s view in $\game_3$, which is the same as $\game_4$.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Game $\game_5$.} In this game the challenger deals with an incoming $\msg{3}^{*}$ with a corresponding $\msg{1}^{*}$ (of the same $\sid$) that is honestly generated. If this is the case and $\pw_\user \neq \pw_\server$, it outputs $\sk_\server\rgets\G$. In any other case it proceeds as in $\game_4$.

\begin{lemma}
	$\Pr[Z_4]=\Pr[Z_5]$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Since $\msg{1}^*$ is honestly generated, $\msg{1}^* = \msg{1}$. By the definition of $\msg{1}$, $C/\pw_\user = A^\kappa$, and since $\pw_\user \neq \pw_\server$, we have $C/\pw_\server \neq A^\kappa$. The rest of the argument proceeds exactly as in \cref{lem:invalid}. \xjy{DOUBLE CHECK}
\end{proof}

\textbf{Game $\game_6$.} In this game the challenger modifies how it determines $\msg{2}$. On receiving $\msg{1}^{*}$, instead of setting $I:=h^r\cdot \pw_\server$, it sets $I:=h^r\cdot g^{N+1}$ where $g^{N+1}$ is a ``dummy'' plaintext that does not belong to the password dictionary (so it is guaranteed that $g^{N+1} \neq \pw_\server$).\footnote{This assumes that the dictionary $\mathsf{Dict} = \{1,\dots,N\}$ is public. If it is not, the challenger can instead sample the ``dummy'' plaintext $\widetilde\pw$ uniformly from $\G$, and $\widetilde\pw \neq \pw_\server$ holds with overwhelming probability.}

\begin{lemma}
	Under the DSDH assumption, $|\Pr[Z_5]-\Pr[Z_6]|\leq\negl(\lambda)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	By \cref{thm:drcca-cs}, under DSDH the Crame--Shoup with labels encryption scheme satisfies DR-CCA-security with auxiliary information $\aux = (x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2,g_1^{r^2},g_2^{r^2},(h^r\cdot m_b)^{r},(cd^{\alpha})^{r^2})$. We show that any environment $\env$ which can distinguish between $\game_5$ and $\game_6$ can be used as a subroutine to build a reduction $\red$ which can break the DR-CCA-security (\cref{fig:dcca}) for Cramer--Shoup with labels (\cref{fig:cs03}). 
	
	$\red$ begins by querying the key generation oracle and receiving the public key $\PK = (\Gamma,\hk,g_1,g_2,c,d,h)$. It sets the $\crs = (\Gamma,g_1,g_2,h,c,d,\hk)$ and begins a simulation of the challenger for $\adv$ (and $\env$). This simulation proceeds as in $\game_5$, with the following difference:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item On receiving a message $\msg{1}^{*}$, $\red$ submits $m_0:=\pw_\server$ (which was provided by $\env$) and $m_1:=g^{N+1}$ as plaintexts for the encryption oracle. It receives in return the target ciphertext $\psi^{*}$, and includes $(F,G,I,J):=\psi^{*}$ as part of $\msg{2}$.
		\item On receiving an adversarially generated message $\msg{2}^{*}$, $\red$ needs to determine whether this message is valid or invalid (recall that in this setting the initialization procedure has not been backdoored, so $\red$ cannot check whether the message is valid as what the real challenger does). To do this, it queries the decryption oracle with $(F,G,I,J)$, and sets the message to be valid if the result is $\pw_\user$ and invalid otherwise. \xjy{How is it guaranteed that $\red$ does not query the decryption oracle on the challenge ciphertext?}
		\item On receiving an adversarially generated message $\msg{3}^{*}$, $\red$ again needs to determine whether $\msg{1}^{*}$ is valid or invalid. To do so, it again queries the decryption oracle with $(A,B,C,D)$ and sets the message to be valid if the result is $\pw_\server$ and invalid otherwise.
		\item $\red$ determines the algebraic exponents of $K$ delivered by $\adv$ using $\msg{3}^{'*}$ and queries the auxiliary oracle to receive $\aux = (g_1^{r_2^2}, g_2^{r_2^2}, c^{r_2}, d^{r_2},(h^{r_2}\cdot m_i)^{r_2},(cd^{\alpha})^{{r_2}^2})$. Using this, in the case that $\msg{1}^{*}$ is adversarially generated and valid, it determines $\sk_\server = A^{x_2}B^{y_2}C^{z_2}D^{w_2}K^{r_2}$, since $K$ is completely determined as some function of $\aux$. It then outputs $\sk_\server$ to $\mathcal{Z}$. \xjy{This might need further explanation; see comment below $\game_2$}
	\end{itemize}

	$\red$ then outputs what $\mathcal{Z}$ outputs.

	It is clear that $\red$ simulates $\game_5$ if the returned ciphertext $\psi^{*}$ is an encryption of $\pw_\server$, while $\red$ simulates $\game_6$ if the returned ciphertext is an encryption of $g^{N+1}$. It follows that $$|\Pr[Z_5]-\Pr[Z_6]|\leq\drcca_{\adv}(\lambda)\leq \negl(\lambda).\eqno\qedhere$$ 
\end{proof}

\textbf{Game $\game_7$.} In this game the challenger deals with incoming message $\msg{2}^{*}$. If $\msg{2}^{*}$ is adversarially generated and invalid, then the challenger outputs $\sk_\user \rgets \G$.

The proof of indistinguishability of this game is closely related to that of game $\game_4$. Note that here either $F^{\chi_1+\beta\zeta_1}G^{\chi_2+\beta\zeta_2}\neq J$ or $I/\pw_\user\neq F^\kappa$. A linear system similar to \cref{eq:linear} follows, and the proof of linear independence is also nearly identical. We can conclude that the session key is uniform in $\game_6$, and equivalence follows immediately: $$\Pr[Z_6]=\Pr[Z_7].$$

\textbf{Game $\game_8$.} In this game the challenger again deals with incoming message $\msg{2}^{*}$. If $\msg{2}^{*}$ is honestly generated, then the challenger outputs $\sk_\user \rgets \G$.

Note that in game $\game_6$ $I$ is set to $h^{r_2} \cdot g^{N+1} = g^{r_2\kappa} \cdot g^{N+1} = F^\kappa \cdot g^{N+1}$, so if $\msg{2}^*$ is honestly generated, it is guaranteed that $I/\pw_\user\neq F^\kappa$. Then the argument is identical to $\game_7$, and we get $$\Pr[Z_7]=\Pr[Z_8].$$

\textbf{Game $\game_9$.} In this game the challenger modifies the client's response to the opening $\newsession$ message. It computes $C:=h^{r}g_1^{N+1}$, similar to how it does in game $\game_6$, encrypting a ``dummy'' password not in the dictionary. 

\begin{lemma}
	Under the DSDH assumption, $|\Pr[Z_8]-\Pr[Z_9]|\leq\negl(\secpar)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Like the proof of $\game_6$, we will show that any environment $\mathcal{Z}$ which can distinguish between the two games can be used to build a reduction which breaks the DR-CCA-security of Cramer--Shoup with labels.
	
	The description of the reduction $\red$ is as follows. $\red$ begins by querying the key generation oracle and receiving the public key $\PK = (\Gamma,\hk,g_1,g_2,c,d,h)$. It sets $\crs := (\Gamma,g_1,g_2,h,c,d,\hk)$ and begins a simulation of the challenger for $\adv$ (and $\env$). This simulation proceeds as in $\game_7$, with the following difference:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item On receiving a message $(\newsession,\sid,\user,\server,\pw_\user)$, $\red$ submits $m_0:=\pw_\user$ and $m_1:=g^{N+1}$ as plaintexts for the encryption oracle. It receives in return the target ciphertext $\psi^{*}$, and sets $(A,B,C,D):=\psi^{*}$.
		\item On receiving an adversarially generated message $\msg{2}^{*}$, the challenger needs to determine whether this message is valid or invalid (recall that in this setting the initialization procedure has not been backdoored). To do this, it queries the decryption oracle with $(F,G,I,J)$, and sets the message to be valid if it is an encryption of $\pw_\user$ and invalid otherwise.
		\item On receiving an adversarially generated message $\msg{3}^{*}$, the challenger again needs to determine whether $\msg{1}^{*}$ is valid or invalid. To do so, it again queries the decryption oracle with $(A,B,C,D)$ and sets the message to be valid if it is an encryption of $\pw_\user$ and invalid otherwise.
		\item The simulator determines the algebraic exponents of the $E$ delivered by the adversary using $\msg{2}^{'*}$ and queries the auxiliary oracle to receive $\aux = (g_1^{r_1^2}, g_2^{r_1^2}, c^{r_1}, d^{r_1},(h^{r_1}\cdot m_i)^{r_1},(cd^{\alpha})^{{r_1}^2})$. Using this, in the case that $\msg{2}^{*}$ is adversarially generated and valid, it determines $\sk_\user = E^{r_1}F^{x_1}G^{y_1}(I')^{z_1}J^{w_1}(\pw')^{z_2}$, since $E$ is completely determined as a function of $\aux$. It then releases $\sk_\user$ to $\mathcal{Z}$.
	\end{itemize}

	$\adv$ then outputs what $\mathcal{Z}$ outputs.
	
	It is clear that the above is a correct simulation of $\game_7$ when $m_0$ is encrypted and $\game_8$ when $m_1$ is encrypted. It follows immediately that $$|\Pr[Z_7]-\Pr[Z_8]|\leq\drcca_{\adv}(\secpar)\leq\negl(\secpar).$$
\end{proof}

\textbf{Game $\game_9$.} In this game we introduce the simulator shown in \cref{fig:agm-sim}. It is easy to see that the simulator does exactly what is done by the challenger of $\game_8$, except for determining whether a message is invalid or valid, which is done by $\pake$. Once this has been determined, it continues the simulation and finds the session key $\sk_i$, which is delegated to $\pake$.

We have found that $\Pr[Z_8]=\Pr[Z_9]$. From the preceding games we can conclude that under the SDSH and DDH assumptions, $$|\Pr[Z_0]-\Pr[Z_9]|\leq\negl(\secpar).$$

	\textbf{If $\party=\server$:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{In Round $\mathbf{R}_2$:} $\SIM$ selects $x_2,y_2,z_2,w_2,r_2\rgets\Z_q$ and sets
			\begin{align*}
				\alpha' &:= \mathsf{HF}_\hk^{\secpar,\Gamma}(\sid,\VK,A,B,C)\\
				E &:= g_1^{x_2}g_2^{y_2}h^{z_2}(cd^{\alpha'})^{w_2}\\
				F &:= g_1^{r_2}\\
				G &:= g_2^{r_2}\\
				I &:= h^{r_2}\cdot g^{N+1}\\
				\beta &:= \mathsf{HF}_\hk^{\secpar,\Gamma}(\msg{1},\sid,E,F,G,I)\\
				J &:= (cd^{\beta})^{r_2}
			\end{align*}
		\item \textbf{On receiving $\msg{3}^{*}$:} If $\msg{1}^{*}\neq\msg{1}$, $\SIM$ finds $C/A^\kappa$ and sends $(\testpwd,\sid,\user,C/A^\kappa)$ to $\pake$. Otherwise it skips this step and sends $(\NewKey,\sid,\user,0_\G)$. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{If $\pake$ outputs `correct guess':} $\SIM$ continues the simulation as described in $\game_2$ and submits $(\NewKey,\sid, \user,\sk_\server)$ to $\pake$.
			\item \textbf{If $\pake$ outputs `wrong guess':} $\SIM$ continues the simulation as described in $\game_4$ and submits $(\NewKey,\sid, \user,\sk_\server)$ to $\pake$.
