	\maketitle
	
	This document contains a proof that the PAKE protocol of Katz, Ostrovsky and Yung (2001) is not UC-secure.
	
	\section{Overview}
	
	At a high level, our attack relies on an adversary $\adv$ that completely disregards the presence of $\server$ and instead interacts with $\user$ while executing $\server$'s algorithm on its own. In particular, once the protocol is initiated by $\user$, $\adv$ assumes the role of the server (discarding the actual server in the process, which plays no part in the protocol) and receives $\msg{1} = \mathsf{VK}|A|B|C|D$. After this, $\adv$ runs the server's algorithm on $\user$'s password $\pw$ and computes $\msg{2} = E|F|G|I|J$. $\user$ then runs its session-key generating algorithm and outputs its session key $\sk = E^{r_1}F^{x_1}G^{y_1}(I')^{z_1}J^{w_1}$. We note that at this point, $\adv$ (and $\env$) have all the information they need to run the server's session-key generating algorithm locally, which computes a session key equal to $\sk$ generated by $\user$.\\
	
	To see why a PPT simulator $\simulator$ cannot simulate this adversary, we attempt an ideal-world execution and pinpoint where it fails. Since $\simulator$ is allowed to choose $\crs=(g_1, g_2, h, c, d)$, it can sample $g_1$ at random and set $h$ such that $h=g_1^{\ell}$. After receiving the $\newsession$ command from $\pake$, $\simulator$ must simulate $\user$'s first message $\msg{1}$. Since $\simulator$ does not know the password, at this point it must (effectively) guess some $\pw^*$ at random; that is, in $\msg{1}$, $C=h^{r_1}\cdot\pw^*$ where $\pw^*$ can be no better than a random password sampled from the dictionary. After $\env$ responds with $\msg{2} = E|F|G|I|J$, since $F = g_1^{r_2}$ and $I = h^{r_2} \cdot \pw$, $\simulator$ can extract $\pw$ as $I/F^\ell$. Once this has been done, $\simulator$ can send a $\testpwd$ command to $\pake$ on the correct $pw$; $\pake$ would mark the $\user$ session $\compromised$ and thus allow $\simulator$ to choose $\user$'s session key $\sk$.\footnote{Recall that a $\testpwd$ \textit{must} be run, since we require that $\msg{1}$ and $\msg{2}$ together with the randomness of the $\user$ and $\adv$ together determine $\sk$; allowing the simulation to proceed without a $\testpwd$ would result in $\pake$ outputting a uniformly random key.} The problem is that even with this information, $\simulator$ still cannot determine what $\sk$ is.\\
	
	To determine $\sk$, $\simulator$ can either run $\server$'s algorithm or $\user$'s algorithm to generate session keys. Recalling that $\msg{2} = E|F|G|I|J$ is provided to $\simulator$ directly from the environment, $\simulator$ cannot use $\server$'s algorithm since it would require the determination of all of $x_2, y_2, z_2, r_2, w_2$, which is computationally infeasible under the hardness of CDH. Alternately, $\simulator$ can run $\user$'s algorithm to determine $\sk$, for which it already has access to $x_1,y_1,z_1,r_1,w_1$ and $E,F,G,I,J$. However, we recall that this $\sk$ output by $\simulator$ must be equal to that which $\env$ determines using its own execution of $\server$'s algorithm (this is what happens in the real world). The problem here is that the password guess $\pw^*$ that $\simulator$ uses while generating $\msg{1}$ is likely incorrect; in fact, we can show that the output of $\server$'s algorithm on $\msg{1},\msg{2}$ and $\msg{3}$ by $\env$ will have $(\pw^{*}/\pw)^{z_2}$ as a factor, and except in the $1/\mathcal{|D|}$ probability case that $\pw^*=\pw$, $\simulator$ cannot determine $z_2$ assuming the hardness of CDH and thus will be unable to determine $\sk$.\\
	
	\section{Proof}

%\xjy{Give a theorem statement first}

	\begin{theorem}
		Assuming the hardness of fixed-CDH, the protocol of [KOY] does not UC-realize $\mathcal{F}_\mathsf{pake}$ in the $\mathcal{F}_{\mathsf{crs}}$-hybrid model.
	\end{theorem}

	\begin{proof}
	
	Consider the environment $\env$ in \Cref{fig:adv} and the dummy adversary. It follows from the correctness of the protocol that in the real-world protocol execution $\env$ always outputs $1$, since the algorithm of $\env$ and $\adv$ is the same as that of an honest server. At a high level, we will show that any simulator that successfully simulates the protocol against $\env$ in the ideal world can be used to solve arbitrary instances of fixed-CDH.\\

				\item $\env$ selects $\pw\xleftarrow{\$}\mathcal{PW}$, where $\mathcal{PW}\subseteq\mathbb{G}$ is the password dictionary. It then sends $(\newsession,\mathsf{sid},\user,\server,\pw)$ to $\user$.

			and instructs $\adv$ to send $\msg{2} := \mathsf{sid}|E|F|G|I|J$ to $\user$. 
			\item $\env$ receives $\msg{3}=\mathsf{sid}|K|\sigma$ from $\adv$ and $(\mathsf{sid}, \sk)$ from $\user$.
			\item $\env$ sets $C':=C/\pw$ and then checks if $\mathsf{Vrfy}_{\mathsf{VK}}(\msg{1}|\msg{2}|K,\sigma)=1$. If yes, it computes $\sk_S:=A^{x_2}B^{y_2}(C')^{z_2}D^{w_2}K^{r_2}$ and outputs $1$ if $\sk_S=\sk$. If either of the two checks fails, it outputs $0$.

	\end{figure}

	Assume that there exists a negligible function $\varepsilon:=\varepsilon(\lambda)$ such that there exists a ``successful'' simulator $\simulator$ for which $\env$ outputs $1$ with probability $1-\varepsilon$ in the ideal world. First, assume that CDH is hard over $(\mathbb{G}, p, h)$. Consider reduction $\mathcal{R}$ which does the following. \xjy{that runs the simulator $\simulator$ as follows (note that $\mathcal{R}$ plays the role of the environment $\env$, the PAKE functionality $\pake$, and the dummy parties $\user$ and $\server$ combined):}\\
	
	\nam{I'm not completely convinced if this is the best way to write this; the proof is correct in the essentials, but I think this needs to be rewritten since I'm not sure what formal part $\mathcal{R}$ is playing here...}
	
	\begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{-1}
        \item $\mathcal{R}$ receives $\mathsf{crs}=(g_1, g_2, h, c, d)$ from $\simulator$, outputs $h$ to its challenger, and receives $(h^a, h^b)$ where $a,b\rgets\mathbb{Z}_p$. \xjy{I moved ``receiving the CRS'' as the 0th step of the formal description of the reduction (and the environment)} \xjy{Is the group order $p$ or $q$? It is called $p$ in this step but $q$ in the second step}
		\item $\mathcal{R}$ sends $(\newsession,\mathsf{sid}, \user, \server)$ to $\simulator$.
		\item $\mathcal{R}$ waits to receive $\msg{1} = \mathsf{sid}|\mathsf{VK}|A|B|C|D$ in response (as the first message from $\user$ to $\server$). It then sets $\pw:=C/h^b$ and samples $x_2,y_2,w_2,r_2\rgets\mathbb{Z}_q$, setting
		\begin{align*}
			\alpha'&:=H(PIDs|A|B|C|D)\\
			E &:= g_1^{x_2}g_2^{y_2}h^{a}(cd^{\alpha'})^{w_2}\\
			F &:= g_1^{r_2}\\
			G &:= g_2^{r_2}\\
			I &:= h^{r_2}\cdot\pw\\
			\beta &:= H(\msg{1}|E|F|G|I)\\
			J &:= (cd^{\beta})^{w_2}
		\end{align*}
		i.e., the same computation as that of the honest server with a special choice of $\pw$ and $z_2$ \xjy{the special choice of $\pw = C/h^b$ and $z_2 = a$}, and sends $\msg{2}:=\mathsf{sid}|E|F|G|I|J$ to $\simulator$.
		\item $\mathcal{R}$ receives $\msg{3}=\mathsf{sid}|K|\sigma$ (as the second message from $\user$ to $\server$) and $(\mathsf{sid},\sk)$ from $\simulator$ (as $\user$'s output to $\env$), and checks if $\mathsf{Vrfy}_\mathsf{VK}(\msg{1}|\msg{2}|K,\sigma)=1$. If yes, \xjy{If not, $\mathcal{R}$ aborts. Otherwise} it calculates 
		$$h'=\frac{\sk}{A^{x_2}B^{y_2}D^{w_2}K^{r_2}}.$$
		\item $\mathcal{R}$ outputs $h'$.		
	\end{enumerate}

		We recall that $\sk_C=\sk_S$ with probability $1-\varepsilon$ by the assumption. Clearly in the protocol execution, we have, setting $C'=C/\pw=h^b$,
		$$\sk_S = A^{x_2}B^{y_2}(C')^{z_2}D^{w_2}K^{r_2}=A^{x_2}B^{y_2}(h^b)^{a}D^{w_2}K^{r_2}$$ which clearly gives $h' = h^{ab}$ with probability $1-\varepsilon$, as claimed, contradicting the hardness of fixed-CDH.

\xjy{Note that $\simulator$'s view while interacting with $\mathcal{R}$ is identical to $\simulator$'s view in the ideal world with the $\env$ in \Cref{fig:adv}; the difference is that $\env$ samples $\pw$ and $z_2$ on its own, whereas $\mathcal{R}$ sets $\pw = C/h^b$ and $z_2 = a$ --- which cannot be detected by $\simulator$. Let $C' = C/\pw = h^b$ and
$$\sk_S = A^{x_2}B^{y_2}(C')^{z_2}D^{w_2}K^{r_2}=A^{x_2}B^{y_2}(h^b)^{a}D^{w_2}K^{r_2}$$
as what $\env$ would compute in its step 4; $\env$ outputs 1 if and only if $\sk_S = \sk$, so by our assumption on $\simulator$, in $\mathcal{R}$'s interaction with $\simulator$, $\sk_S = \sk$ with probability $1-\varepsilon$. But this gives $h' = h^{ab}$ with probability $1-\varepsilon$, i.e., $\mathcal{R}$ wins with probability $1-\varepsilon$, contradicting the hardness of fixed-CDH.}
		\end{proof}
	
	
	\textcolor{gray}{//everything below is deprecated comments.}\\

	
	First, we will assume the hardness of CDH over the group $(\mathbb{G},g,p)$. Let Let $g^a,g^b$ be two elements where $a,b\xleftarrow{\$}\mathbb{Z}_p$. 
	
	Formally, assume that there exists a simulator $\simulator$ such that $\env$ always outputs $1$ in the ideal world. \xjy{Formally we cannot really assume this; need to say ``such that $\env$ outputs $1$ with all but negligible probability in the ideal world''. I am not entirely sure for now, but we probably need to be more specific and say ``there is a negligible function $\epsilon$ such that $\env$ outputs $1$ with probability $1-\epsilon$ in the ideal world.''} We will use this simulator to compute $g^{ab}$. \xjy{We will construct a reduction $\mathcal{R}$ that uses $\simulator$ to solve the CDH problem in $(\mathbb{G},g,p)$. (I think it's better to explicitly mention a reduction.)} Our technique works as follows: first, we send \xjy{everywhere you say ``we do something'', change it to ``$\mathcal{R}$ does something''} $(\newsession,\mathsf{sid},\user,\server,\pw)$ to $\pake$ \xjy{conceptually I think $\mathcal{R}$ should play the role of $\pake$ (if you are not sure what I am talking about, chat with me in our meeting or on Slack)} and recieve $\msg{1} = \mathsf{sid}|\mathsf{VK}|A|B|C|D$ in response from $\simulator$. We set $\pw = C/g^b$ and sample $x_2,y_2,z_2,w_2,r_2\xleftarrow{\$}\mathbb{Z}_q$. 
	\begin{align*}
		\alpha'&:=H(PIDs|A|B|C|D)\\
		E &:= g_1^{x_2}g_2^{y_2}h^{z_2}(cd^{\alpha'})^{w_2}\\
		F &:= g_1^{r_2}\\
		G &:= g_2^{r_2}\\
		I &:= h^{r_2}\cdot\pw\\
		\beta &:= H(\msg{1}|Server|E|F|G|I)\\
		J &:= (cd^{\beta})^{w_2}
	\end{align*}
	i.e., the same computation as that of the honest server with a special choice of $\pw$. Forwarding this to $\pake$, we recieve $\msg{3}=K|\mathsf{Sig}$ and $(\mathsf{sid}, \sk)$ in return.
